For this test, for the number of page frame = 10, the answer will be 1. However, for 50 and 100, it is already 14.
This will happen because at the moment of the "repetition" of the numbers, the page numbers (in virtual memory) will already be completely updated, however, for a larger value of physical memory (more precisely, the number of pages in it) they will still be there. Thus, the number of hits depends on the number of page frame.
 Also, do not forget about the number of allocated bits, because the more bits, the longer it takes to track when the page was last taken.
 I can't show it on my tests, because in theory the test
2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 conveys this meaning, however, only when the update occurs every k seconds ,
